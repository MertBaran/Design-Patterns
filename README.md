# Design-Patterns
This is my bachelor's thesis subject. I created a real-life problem for each design pattern(GoF) and developed them in Java. I also explained with UML class diagrams.

In software engineering, a design pattern is a general repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. A design pattern isn't a finished design that can be transformed directly into code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

• Design patterns help you analyze the more abstract areas of a program by providing concrete, well-tested solutions.

• Design patterns help you write code faster by providing a clearer picture of how you are implementing the design.

• Design patterns encourage more legible and maintainable code by following well-understood paths.

• Design patterns increasingly provide a common language and jargon for programmers.
